# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This scheduler app allows a user to plan their work day on an hour-by-hour basis.  It also allows 
the user to save their work and retrieve it later (using localStorage).  It uses color coding
to identify whether each block is in the past, present, or future.  I built this project to
help familiarize myself with jQuery and Bootstrap, and to gain experience working with other
libraries on an as-needed basis (in this case, Day.js).

## Usage
Each block of time includes a textarea for the user to make notes.  The button (with a disk icon)
next to the textarea will save the notes, and if the app is closed and reopened, they will 
automatically be restored.

## Credits
The initial files were provided by University of Toronto Coding Bootcamp.  Also, the project uses
the following libraries:
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/)
